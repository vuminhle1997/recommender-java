# Introduction to Recommender System 

This repository contains code projects from University of Minnesota that teaches the concept of Recommender Systems in Coursera.

**It should not be redistributed and the code itself belongs to the course and the instructors.**

The repository itself displays the accomplish work I've done and can be easily started with IntelliJ Community Edition or IntelliJ Ultimate (both softwares must be below <= 2019), but can also be started with a current Visual Studio Code Version.
The whole course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems).
